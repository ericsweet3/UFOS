# UFO Sightings: The Truth is Out There

The purpose of this challenge was to take a system of filtering specific data for UFO sightings and upgrade it by adding more filters that could be used by anyone!
1) Date
2) City
3) State
4) Country
5) Shape

Data: data.js
Tools used: javacript and HTML

The webpage has now been updated to include further filter queries such as city, state, country, and even the shape (which will most likely always be circle). Previously, you could only filter by date, but now if you want to see a possible sighting from Bonita, California, you can. Or you could look for circle shaped UFOs on January 2nd of whatever years theres data on. Now, one drawback of this website/filtering system is that currently the dataset that we are working with is obviously very limited. Hopefully this could be exanded upon in the future.
